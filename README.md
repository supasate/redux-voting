# Redux Voting

A simple voting application using Redux, React, and Socket.io.

The application is developed based on a great tutorial [A Comprehensive Guide to Test-First Development with Redux, React, and Immutable](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html).

This version is enhanced with redux-devtools 3.0-beta-3. So, you can play around with Time Travel Debugging.
